When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

To share your changes with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There can be merge conflicts which will have to be taken care of each time git pulls the changes automatically.

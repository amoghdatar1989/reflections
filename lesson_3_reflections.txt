When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

To share your changes with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There can be merge conflicts which will have to be taken care of each time git pulls the changes automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches help you work on different things in the same repository. Clones copies a remote repository and links it your local repository  for you to make changes to it. Fork duplicates a remote repository remotely, so that you can change the forked repository without making changes to the original one.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It will help you to know the latest changes made to the remote branch after the last known state.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without github, everyone using the shared resources will have to communicate each time they are making changes to make sure that everyone else agrees on the changes. Also, when someone is making the changes, they will have to make sure that no else is also making changes at the same time so that neither of their changes are lost. This will be the difficult part. The easy part is that you wont have to deal with all the git commands.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

You should create a separate branch when the changes are substantial and is a complete logical change in itself. This helps us to track the change, as a whole, better. When the change is very small it can be directly merged into master, but it should be avoided.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

To share your changes with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There can be merge conflicts which will have to be taken care of each time git pulls the changes automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches help you work on different things in the same repository. Clones copies a remote repository and links it your local repository  for you to make changes to it. Fork duplicates a remote repository remotely, so that you can change the forked repository without making changes to the original one.

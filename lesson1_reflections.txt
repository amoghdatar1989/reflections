Using a diff tool to find the differences in files is better because you dont have to go through the entire file. The tool only shows you the sections which have changed.

Having access to entire history of a file can help you recognize what mistakes you commit the most, so that the next time you will avoid thems.

Manual commit gives you moew flexibility as compared to auto commit/save. By flexibility, I mean the amount of changes you want to commit is in your hands.

Google docs does version control per file, where as GIT does version control for a repository which can be a collection of files.

Git log will give you a list of all the commits that have been done in the repository, for all files. Using git diff on two commits will show you what were the changes introduced by the commits in the files

Using version control, you can go back to different versions of the repository, to find out which one casued an issue. This flexibility gives you the confidence to make changes that could potemtially break something.
